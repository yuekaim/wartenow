      Footnotes will be counted automatically. Just add [^Fußnoten-Beschreibung] in the running text to add a footnote.

      Unfortunately it is (currently) not possible to have another square brackets [...] inside a footnote.
      So this: [^Footnote [...] text] should be converted to [^Footnote (...) text].

    label: Block editor

      The content of each article can be edited using the so-called "Block-Editor". That means, that the content as a whole consits of different building blocks to represent different types of media.
      E.g. there is a "Text"-Block for regular text and and "Image"-Block to insert images.

      To insert an image in between a longer text, it is necessary to first divide the text block into 2 seperate blocks. After that, a new image block can be added between them.

  footnotes:
    type: info
    text: |
      Footnotes will be counted automatically. Just add [^Fußnoten-Beschreibung] in the running text to add a footnote.

      Unfortunately it is (currently) not possible to have another square brackets [...] inside a footnote.
      So this: [^Footnote [...] text] should be converted to [^Footnote (...) text].

  images:

      Images can be uploaded in various sizes but best is:
      **JPG**, RGB color space
      **500 KB – 4 MB** filesize or **2000 – 4000 px** width

    text: |
      In the block editor you can also add videos.
      For embeds from YouTube or Vimeo, select the "Video" Block, for embedding a video from the HFBK Mediathek, select the "HTML" block:
      1. Go to the video page at HFBK Mediathek
      2. Click on "Share"/"Teilen"
      3. Copy the iFrame code
      4. Paste that into the newly created HTML block

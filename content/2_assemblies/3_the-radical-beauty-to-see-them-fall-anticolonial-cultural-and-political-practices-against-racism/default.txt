Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>Colonial monuments do not only represent offensive and violent&nbsp;reivindications in regard to European history of imperialism, they are an essential part of the narratives needed in order to reinforce the institutional racism sustained by the European migratory control system.&nbsp;<\/p><p>The unnamed indigenous male represented on his knees in front of a priest at the bottom of the Columbus monument in Barcelona, represents the relationship that Europe wants to maintain nowadays with migrant people from the global south; it represents the policies of integration, persecution and deportation imposed to those who arrive from the former colonies. Who built them and for who are important these monuments nowadays is a crucial question, as crucial as understanding the political reasons of antiracist&nbsp;movements that tear them down,&nbsp; the importance of the&nbsp;aesthetical&nbsp;act of doing so and the genealogy of anticolonial visual representations that have confronted colonial monuments and accompanied antirracists&nbsp;grassroots movements&nbsp;historically.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&nbsp;<\/p><p>Daniela&nbsp;Ortiz Peru <br>1985 \/ Lives and works in Barcelona. Through her work&nbsp;Daniela Ortiz&nbsp;aims to generate visual narratives in which the concepts of nationality,&nbsp;racialization, social class and genre are explored in order to critically understand structures of&nbsp;colonial,&nbsp;patriarcal&nbsp;and capitalist power. Her recent projects and research deal with the&nbsp;European migratory control system, its links to colonialism and the legal structure created by&nbsp;European institutions in order to inflict violence towards racialized and migrant communities. She has also also developed projects&nbsp;about the Peruvian upper class and its exploitative relationship with domestic workers. Recently&nbsp;her artistic practice has turned back into visual and manual work, developing art pieces in ceramic,&nbsp;collage and in formats such as children books in order to take distance from eurocentric conceptual art aesthetics.&nbsp;Together with her artistic practice she is mother of a 4 year&nbsp;old, gives talks, workshops, do investigation and participate in discussions&nbsp;on Europe\u2019s migratory control system and its ties to coloniality in different contexts.<\/p>"},"id":"278b73e0-eb7e-4a4f-853f-2fa840eb6470","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]

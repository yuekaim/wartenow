Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>TAF! is a photography workshop designed for direct action.<\/p><p>The Co-ordinator Oriana Elic\u0327abe, is documentary photographer and member of the Enmedio Artist Collective (Barcelona). For TAF! the spaces of the city resonate at a frequency that can be disrupted with images when you least expect it, suddenly, from nowhere: \u201cTAF!\u201d Our showroom is the street. The framework for our images is our social environment: the curators, the people involved in the struggles we represent. Our cameras are mirrors that reflect who we are and what happens to us. The goal: to approach the other. In TAF! workshops we use various methodologies to break through the least-explored terrain of photography; that which serves a political function as much as in its distribution and its realization. Join TAF! to see what a photograph can do!<\/p><p><\/p><p>Oriana Elic\u0327abe<br>Born in Argentina. Documentary photographer and cultural agitator.

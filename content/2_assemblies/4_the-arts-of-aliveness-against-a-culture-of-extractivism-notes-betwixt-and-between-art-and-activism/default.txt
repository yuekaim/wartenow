Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>Weaving personal stories of adventures on the tightrope between art and activism and ideas stolen from theory, this lecture is a provocation against the Capitalocene. We have had a little over 200 years of Art and the world is getting worse ! The invention of Art emerged from the white colonial metropolises a little over 200 years ago, at around the same time that extractivist industrial capitalism began to dominate society. With it came the toxic dualisms between art and life, nature and culture, mind body, individual and common and our culture turned away from life. We all know the results. Faced with the urgent need for radical civilizations shift, do we continue art as usual or can it be a beautiful form of sabotage against the war of the economy against life.<\/p><p>Jay Jordan<br>Labelled a &nbsp;\"Domestic Extremist\" by the police, and \u201ca magician of rebellion\u201d by the press,&nbsp;art activist&nbsp;J Jordan likes all spaces in-between.

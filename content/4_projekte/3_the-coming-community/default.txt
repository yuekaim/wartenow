Abstract: <p>How do we work together, build and understand community against, within and beyond capitalist structures?</p><p>The Coming Community aims to experiment the possibilities of ephemeral cohabitations and gathering in a specific space-time: a place inhabited by “disseminated, temporary and nomadic” communities - to use the words of Giorgio Agamben, who inspired this project.<br>Nine artists from France, Switzerland, Slovakia, Czech Republic and Russia developed through video, voice, movement or sculpture subjects related to: performativity, language, ritual, mythology and technology. Originally planned to be held at Coco Velten in Belsunce, Marseille (November 13-28 2020) as part of Manifesta 13, The Coming Community emerged from the encounter and dialogue between two duos of curators based in France and Switzerland – each imagining different strategies on the importance of interpersonal relationships and collaborative process within the frame of curatorial practices.<br></p><p>A proposal by ex situ – Cassandre Langlois &amp; Simona Dvořáková – and the curatorial duo Gabrielle Boder &amp; Tadeo Kohan.<br>With contributions by Station of Commons (Grégoire Rousseau and Juan Gomez), the artists Flora Bouteille, Anatol Dirkas, Michala Julínyová, Nastasia Meyrat, Nicolas Pesquier, Rudolf Samohejl, Trapier Duportē, Victor Villafagne, Victor Yudaev, and Nora Sternfeld (HFBK Hamburg).<br>The project was planned as a part of Manifesta 13 in Marseille.

Exploring the current situation in terms of collective understanding we decided to start by being less stuck and alone. Coping with the gap between what we wish for and what we can do, we keep on nevertheless in a research on exposure in interwoven relations that affect each other.<\/p><p>Thinking about para-institutions, we take Manifesta as a starting point. In a moment of its closure we realise that it became an empty signifier, a context that created economies, a pretext that brought us together. Practices from different fields converge to try to understand what a para-institution is when the institution is closed and the para persists.<\/p><p>Thought as an \u201cactive space\u201d (stage, content and context - F. Malzacher, J. Warsza), this collective project explores potentialities and policies of ephemeral communities as tools to create a space of commoning, With this approach, it works on and with the local context, using the relationship between public space and audience to study situations participating in collective power or in new narratives.<br>We persist in thinking, discussing and writing together. In the context of the current situation, the physical part of the project takes on in multiple digital and textual media. Three virtual meetings during November will emphasize the possibilities of rethinking the exhibition space in terms of conviviality and collective understanding. Beginning with \"How do we come together in a world that isolates us?\" by Nora Sternfeld, our interest intersects with different institutional models such as the \u201cpara-institution\u201d. This alternative model dealing with cultural-political relations that propose the pedagogy of \"refusing the refusal\u201d instead of simple criticism. With theses approaches, the result will be an experimental anthology created in alternative ways of publishing and distributing.<br>Composed of theoretical reflections, it will bring together the perspectives and processes of all invited artists. In collaboration with Station of Commons, Belsunce Project and Copie Machine, this anthology will be printed in Marseille, Hamburg, Prague and Geneva and distributed for free.<\/p>"},"id":"1bf944f6-f628-4f81-8780-7e5a5df53fcb","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"code":"<iframe src=\"https:\/\/archive.org\/embed\/coming-community-p1\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>"},"id":"bdae6d3c-94ec-43f6-8699-f8f34e901c0f","isHidden":false,"type":"html"},{"content":{"text":"<p>In this framework, Station of Commons investigates digital commoning practices and how find distance from private on-line corporate.

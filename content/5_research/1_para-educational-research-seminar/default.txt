Text: [{"content":{"text":"<p>How can educational and curatorial practices of knowledge production challenge what can be said, done and seen? In an international transdisciplinary research Seminar we think about educational research and exhibition studies within and beyond the exhibition, about case studies within and beyond the canon and about research within and beyond western methodologies.<\/p><p>The seminar is an ongoing open context for researchers in educational research and exhibition studies. It follows strategies of knowledge production as exploration, investigation, imagination and reflection.&nbsp;The task of the seminar is both, very pragmatic towards advancing research processes and admitting that research is full of loopings, blockages and new beginnings.<\/p>"},"id":"ef43d4c7-4fe5-446f-9d82-b03ef41ee4eb","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
